For 26 years, IRF has funded and operated rhino conservation programs in Africa and Asia, focusing expertise and resources in areas where rhinos are most in need of protection, and where conservation efforts will do the most good. At the heart of IRF's vision is the belief that these magnificent species should endure for future generations, and that protecting rhinos ensures the survival of many other species, including people. Since its founding, IRF has also provided funding for scientific research that enhances the ability to manage rhinoceros populations both in the wild. IRF has awarded nearly $700,000 to applied rhino research in the past 10 years, and is the only source of funding exclusively devoted to rhinoceros.",

Using best practices from around the country, APA! developed programs to care specifically for these groups, thereby reducing their staggering over-representation on euthanasia lists and directly increasing the city's save rate. With a safety net for homeless pets now established and sustainable in Austin, Austin Pets Alive! is now scaling its impact by helping other communities replicate its successes through mentorship and education. This takes place chiefly through the Maddie's\u00ae Lifesaving Academy, which brings apprenticeships from across the country to Austin to learn hands-on and through classwork directly from Austin Pets Alive! Leaders how to create a safety net for all shelter pets in their own communities.",

Our mission is to strengthen disaster response in America by rescuing and recruiting dogs and partnering them with firefighters and other first responders to find people buried alive in the wreckage of disasters. We offer the professionally trained canines and an ongoing training program at no cost to fire departments. And we ensure lifetime care for every dog in our program: once rescued, these dogs never need to be rescued again. There are currently 71 SDF-trained Search Teams across the country, located in California, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska, Utah, Virginia and Baja California. Thanks to Mutual Aid Agreements between counties, cities and states, these precious, life-saving resources can be shared regionally, nationally, and internationally.",

In 1998, Make Way for Books' founder Dr. Mary Jan Bancroft answered a newspaper listing to read to four-year-olds at a preschool in Tucson. Mary Jan found that this center did not have age-appropriate, quality picture books. Deciding to explore this need further, Mary Jan found that most of the childcare centers serving economically-disadvantaged children had few to zero quality books for young children. That same year, Mary Jan founded Make Way for Books (MWFB) to meet this incredible need and began providing books to under-resourced sites and offering early literacy workshops for educators and parents. Today, MWFB has provided services to nearly 300 preschools and childcare centers. Each year, MWFB serves more than 30,000 children and families and 700 educators.",

To advance our mission, we operate three programs: our core House Program, a Care Mobile Program and a Family Room Program. Our Houses are built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on healing their child. Services include housing, meals, 24-hour transportation to and from the hospital, laundry facilities, positive distractions and connections with other families going through similar experiences. Our Ronald McDonald Care Mobile provides care for underserved children in metro Atlanta to address the number one diagnosis at Children's locations-asthma. With the Care Mobile, we aim to create stronger and healthier families. Our Family Room provides the comforts of home while in the hospital environment. We aim to provide a refuge for families just steps away from their child's hospital bed where they can rest, reflect and refuel.",

We have one strategy. It's relational; helping Christians to reach the lost with the Word of God, using Gospels of John. There are two ways we do that. 1. We reach out to Individuals and equip them, our members, to share the Gospel of John one-on-one. 2.

Across the United States, cities in every state are becoming more post-Christian. Because of this, Church Leaders are now more open to trying new things. In particular, they are interested in creating environments where those outside of the church feel safe bringing questions they have about Christianity and feeling welcomed, heard and not judged. Leaders are discovering that Alpha can provide this space within their church. The growing need for a tool like Alpha means it is poised for rapid expansion in the US.

We have supported and publicized research on our era's most challenging public policy issues: taxes, health care, energy, the legal system, policing, crime, homeland security, urban life, education, race, culture, and many others. Our work has won new respect for market-oriented policies and helped make reform a reality. We have cultivated a staff of senior fellows who work in the Institute's nine policy centers, which study and promote reform in areas ranging from health care, higher education, legal policy, and urban development to race relations, immigration, energy, and counterterrorism.",

From the Cold War to the war on terrorism, from disputes over the role of religion in public life to battles over the nature of the family, EPPC and its scholars have consistently sought to defend the great Western ethical imperatives - respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, individual freedom and responsibility, justice, the rule of law, and limited government. Through its core programs, EPPC and its scholars work to influence policymakers and to transform the culture through the world of ideas.",
