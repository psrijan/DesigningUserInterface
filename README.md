## Function Grapher

This is a canvas based html application that is used to draw polynomial graphs. The main features of this application contains
1. Draw graphs of upto order 3
2. Dynamically modify the graph when coeffs of the graph change
3. Have an index of points when user hovers over any x coordinate of the graph.


## Result:
